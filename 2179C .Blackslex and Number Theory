here an array is given and we have to make it identical and for that reason we can choose an index i from the array and replace
        a[i]=a[i] mod x; here we can choose x as per our wish
        take an example :
        arr a= 2,5,7,9
        here 1. we can make them identical by making all of them zero and so we have to mod them with the same number so
        
        number         x
        2              2
        5              5
        7              7
        9              9
        here the minimum x is 2
        2. and secondly after sorting them we can make all the elements equal to first value. And no other chances are left to make them identical.
        here we will make every element 2;
        number         x
        2              we won't mod it
        5              3
        7              5
        9              7
        here the minimum x is 3
        so at first x was 2 and then it was 3 so the maximized value is 3 and ans is also 3;

        so we can find it by choosing max value between the first number and the diff between 2nd-1st number.
        according to example 1st value of x is 2 and 2nd is 3 which we can achieve by substracting 2nd number - 1st number;
